Basil Game Engine

A game engine using the OpenGL API based on the tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). This engine is not intended to ever be 100% perfect and ready for actually developing video games. This is more of a fun project for me, and a way to showcase some of my skills and knowledge.
